"""Standalone process that reaps stale RQ job and worker registries.

Runs an infinite loop cleaning the started, finished, and failed job registries
of the high and default queues so orphaned jobs (from crashed or restarted
workers) do not accumulate, and prunes dead worker registrations whose Redis
keys expired (hard-killed containers never deregister, leaving ghost rows in
the dashboard's Queue Workers table); a sibling to the worker entrypoints.

Main Features:
* Periodic cleanup of started/finished/failed registries every 10 seconds.
* Dead worker registrations removed via clean_worker_registry per queue.
* Zombie worker hashes reaped: a job-count increment landing after the worker
  key expired recreates it without a TTL, leaving a permanent ghost row with no
  heartbeat - any registration without a last_heartbeat is deregistered.
* Interrupted server-alignment sweeps recovered: a sweep whose RQ job died (e.g.
  killed by a worker restart) or vanished from Redis entirely is revoked and
  replaced with a fresh alignment covering every server.
* Orphaned main tasks failed: a task_status row is committed BEFORE its job is
  enqueued, so a Redis outage can leave a PENDING row with nothing behind it -
  and get_active_main_task counts that as a live task, so every later Start would
  answer 409 forever. Rows past a grace period whose RQ job does not exist are
  marked FAILURE.
* Logs only when something is actually reaped, and survives per-iteration errors.
