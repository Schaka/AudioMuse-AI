# **AudioMuse-AI - Where Music Takes Shape** 

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshot/AM-AI-MAP.png?raw=true" alt="AudioMuse-AI Logo" width="480">
</p>

AudioMuse-AI is an opensource and self-hosted tool that uses sonic analysis to rediscover forgotten songs in your music library and generate groove-aware playlists that also capture the meaning behind each track, without relying on metadata or external APIs.

You can run it locally with Docker Compose or Podman, deploy it at scale in a Kubernetes cluster (**AMD64** and **ARM64** supported), or use native applications available for **macOS, Windows, and Linux**. It integrates with major self-hosted music servers including [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/), [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org), [LMS](https://github.com/epoupon/lms/tree/master), [Lyrion](https://lyrion.org/), [Emby](https://emby.media), and [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), with more integrations planned.

> **Prefer not to self-host?** We're proud that [Elestio](https://elest.io/open-source/audiomuse-ai) picked AudioMuse-AI as a managed cloud service. Take a look at their [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow89q6gQ1mM). It shows how easy it is to get started and gives a good introduction to AudioMuse-AI, its features, and what you can do with it.

> **Need a hosted LLM provider?** AudioMuse-AI supports OpenAI-compatible APIs through the existing `OPENAI` provider. [Atlas Cloud](https://www.atlascloud.ai/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=AudioMuse-AI) is one hosted option you can configure this way; see the [configuration parameters](docs/PARAMETERS.md#openai-compatible-hosted-providers) for details.

AudioMuse-AI lets you explore your music library in innovative ways, just **start with an initial analysis**, and you’ll unlock features like:
* **Clustering**: Automatically groups sonically similar songs, creating genre-defying playlists based on the music's actual sound.
* **Instant Playlists**: Simply tell the AI what you want to hear-like "high-tempo, low-energy music" and it will instantly generate a playlist for you.
* **Music Map**: Discover your music collection visually with a vibrant, genre-based 2D map.
* **Playlist from Similar Songs**: Pick a track you love, and AudioMuse-AI will find all the songs in your library that share its sonic signature, creating a new discovery playlist.
* **Song Paths**: Create a seamless listening journey between two songs. AudioMuse-AI finds the perfect tracks to bridge the sonic gap.
* **Sonic Fingerprint**: Generates playlists based on your listening habits, finding tracks similar to what you've been playing most often.
* **Song Alchemy**: Mix your ideal vibe, mark tracks as "ADD" or "SUBTRACT" to get a curated playlist and a 2D preview. Export the final selection directly to your media server.
* **Text Search**: search your song with simple text that can contains mood, instruments and genre like calm piano songs.
* **Lyrics Search**: search your library by theme, story or meaning, like love songs, not just the sound.

> **Lyrics language support:** the Lyrics Search feature works only with the **72 languages** listed below.

## Quick Start Deployment (Containerized)

Get AudioMuse-AI running in minutes with Docker Compose.

If you need more deployment example take a look at [DEPLOYMENT](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) page.

For a full list of configuration parameter take a look at [PARAMETERS](docs/PARAMETERS.md) page.

For the architecture design of AudioMuse-AI, take a look to the [ARCHITECTURE](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) page.

From `v1.0.0`, only PostgreSQL, Redis, and `TZ` configuration must still be configured via environment variables. All other configuration values are managed through the browser setup wizard and persisted in the database. For compatibility with legacy installations, environment variables are imported into the database automatically on first startup. The Setup Wizard is shown on clean installation as lending page and is also available later from the menu under Administration > Setup Wizard.

**Prerequisites:**
* Docker and Docker Compose installed
* A running media server (Navidrome, Jellyfin, Lyrion, Emby, or Plex)
* See [Hardware Requirements](#hardware-requirements)

**Steps:**

1. **Create your environment file:**
   ```bash
   cp deployment/.env.example deployment/.env
   ```

   You can customize the setup by editing `deployment/.env` before startup. As a minimum, it is suggested to change the default database user and password, but you can also override other PostgreSQL and Redis connection parameters if needed:

   ```env
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
   ```

2. **Start the services:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yaml up -d
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   - Web UI: `http://localhost:8000`
   - Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI): `http://localhost:8000/apidocs/`
     (when authentication is enabled, log in via the Web UI first - `/apidocs/`
     is gated by the same JWT cookie as the rest of the app.)

4. **Run your first analysis:**
   - Navigate to "Analysis and Clustering" page
   - Click "Start Analysis" to scan your library
   - Wait for completion, then explore features like clustering and music map

5. **Stopping the services:**
```bash
docker compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yaml down
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> AudioMuse-AI is designed to work with PostgreSQL v15 as in the deployment example. Different versions could cause errors.

## Native Deployment

Prefer not to use Docker? We ship native packages for **macOS, Linux and Windows**, attached to each [release](https://github.com/NeptuneHub/AudioMuse-AI/releases). Each bundles the whole stack (embedded PostgreSQL, Redis, web UI and workers), so you don't need Docker or an external database. Once started, open **http://127.0.0.1:8000**.

> The apps are not signed, so your OS may warn you on first launch, see the per-platform notes below for how to allow them.

<details>
<summary><b>macOS</b> - Apple Silicon, <code>AudioMuse-AI-arm64.zip</code> (from <code>v2.1.2</code>)</summary>

- Unzip and move `AudioMuse-AI.app` to `/Applications`.
- Remove the quarantine flag (the app is unsigned), either way:
  - **Terminal:** `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/AudioMuse-AI.app`, then double-click - the icon appears in your menu bar.
  - **No Terminal:** double-click and dismiss the warning, then System Settings → Privacy & Security → "Open Anyway", authenticate, and launch again.
- Runs only on Apple Silicon (ARM) on recent macOS (tested on macOS 15.3.1, Mac Mini M4 / 16 GB).

**Files:** data (database, Redis, temp audio) in `~/Library/AudioMuse-AI`, log at `~/Library/Logs/AudioMuse-AI/audiomuse.log`
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Linux</b> - x86_64 / arm64, <code>.deb</code> or <code>.rpm</code> (from <code>v2.1.3</code>)</summary>
  
- **Install as root** (writes to `/opt` and the system app/service dirs):
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo dpkg -i AudioMuse-AI-<arch>-linux.deb` (where `<arch>` is `x86_64` or `aarch64`)
  - Fedora/RHEL: `sudo rpm -i AudioMuse-AI-<arch>-linux.rpm` (where `<arch>` is `x86_64` or `aarch64`)
- **Run as your normal user** (never with `sudo`/root - it stores data in your home and won't start as root):
  - `audiomuse-ai start` (stop with `audiomuse-ai stop`), or auto-start on login with `systemctl --user enable --now audiomuse-ai`.
- Verified on **Debian 12 (bookworm)** (glibc 2.36). The `.rpm` is the same payload, expected to work on recent Fedora / RHEL 9, but too old for RHEL/Rocky/Alma 8 (glibc 2.28). Feedback on RPM-based distros is welcome.

**Files** (under the launching user's home): data (database, Redis, temp audio) in `~/.local/share/AudioMuse-AI`, log at `~/.local/state/AudioMuse-AI/logs/audiomuse.log` (newest entries first)
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Windows</b> - x86_64, <code>AudioMuse-AI-amd64-windows.zip</code> (from <code>v2.1.4</code>)</summary>

- Unzip the portable archive anywhere.
- From a terminal you can start with `AudioMuse-AI.exe start` and stop with `AudioMuse-AI.exe stop`.
- Runs only on x86_64 (Intel/AMD) on Windows 10/11.

**Files:** data (database, Redis, temp audio) in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AudioMuse-AI`, log at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AudioMuse-AI\logs\audiomuse.log` (newest entries first)
</details>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before updating a native version, first stop any running instance.

## **Hardware Requirements**
AudioMuse-AI has been tested on:
* **Intel**: HP Mini PC with Intel i5-6500, 16 GB RAM and NVMe SSD
* **ARM**: Raspberry Pi 5, 8 GB RAM and NVMe SSD / Mac Mini M4 16GB / Amphere based VM with 4core 8GB ram

**Minimum requirements:**
* CPU: 4-core Intel with AVX2 support (usually produced in 2015 or later) or ARM
* RAM: 8 GB RAM
* DISK: NVME SSD storage

For more information about the GPU deployment requirements have a look to the [GPU](docs/GPU.md) page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use virtualization (e.g. Proxmox), make sure to pass through the host CPU. QEMU's virtual CPU lacks AVX2 support, which will prevent AudioMuse-AI from starting.

## **Docker Image Tagging Strategy**

Our GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds and publishes Docker images with the following tags:

* **`:latest`**
  Last released image.
  **Use it for automatic update.**

  * **`:X.Y.Z`** (e.g. `:1.0.0`, `:0.1.4-alpha`)
  Immutable images built from **Git release tags**.
  **Reccommanded for most user. Pinned deployments. You decide when to update by changing the version manually**

* **`:devel`**
  Build from main on each commit/pr merged. It's a less stable build 
  **Recommended only for testing and early adopters.**

* **`:pr-<NUMBER>`** (e.g. `:pr-661`)
  Build generated for a specific open **pull request** (non-draft), to preview its changes before they are merged.
  **For reviewing and testing that single PR**

* **`-noavx2`** variants
  Experimental images for CPUs **without AVX2 support**, using legacy dependencies.
  **Not recommended** unless required for compatibility.

* **`-nvidia`** variants
  Images that support the use of GPU for both Analysis and Clustering.
  **Not recommended** for old GPU.

> Versioning is Major.Minor.Patch release. Eventually (rare) model change that could require a new analysis could happen in Major and Minor release.
> Read the [release note](https://github.com/NeptuneHub/AudioMuse-AI/releases) before any update especially for Major and Minor release.
