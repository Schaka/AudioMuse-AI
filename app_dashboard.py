"""Flask blueprint for the dashboard landing page.

Serves the `/` home page and its summary API, showing recent activity, content
metrics, index counts, active workers, and scheduled tasks.

Every number the dashboard publishes is classified on two axes:

* SCOPE - CATALOG (the deduplicated union of every server, i.e. the ``score``
  table) or SERVER (one music server, i.e. ``music_servers`` + the
  ``track_server_map`` rows pointing at it). Nothing is both.
* CADENCE - SNAPSHOT (precomputed into the ``dashboard_stats`` singleton) or
  LIVE (cheap enough to recompute on every poll). Nothing is in between. The
  SNAPSHOT itself refreshes on two timers that merge into the one blob: the
  cheap FAST metrics every 60s, and the heavier distribution charts hourly.

Main Features:
* Routes: `/` dashboard page and `/api/dashboard/summary`.
* SNAPSHOT tier: the FAST block (CATALOG counts, per-SERVER counts) via
  ``refresh_dashboard_stats()`` every 60s; the CHARTS block (Genres, Moods
  Coverage, Tempo) via ``refresh_dashboard_charts_stats()`` hourly, carrying its
  own ``charts_updated_at`` stamp so the UI can label it honestly.
* LIVE tier: workers (Redis), recent tasks and cron (tiny tables) only.
